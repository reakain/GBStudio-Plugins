# GBStudio Plugins

I had a couple plugins I made for multi-step events that I found myself repeating too often. Most of these are for different single or multi-actor animations and social events. There are several other plugin repos folks have made, and I used them as a reference for laying out my own plugins. The links to all those resources are [here](#Resources)

## Usage and Installation

Copy the plugins folder to the folder your assets folder is stored in. 

## Plugin Listing

### Actor Hop
Make your actor do a little hop, or several hops with a set pause between them. Shows up as Actor > Actor Hop. You select an actor, provide the number of hops, and the pause interval. (6 frames is the default, which is roughly 0.1 seconds)

### Social Hop
Do sequential number sets of hops between two actors.

### Player Sprite Select
Some cursed nonsense needs figure if this will even work

### Dialogue Tree Builder
I built too many dialogue trees. Needs finishing
