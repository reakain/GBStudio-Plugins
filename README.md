# GBStudio Plugins

I had a couple plugins I made for multi-step events that I found myself repeating too often. Most of these are for different single or multi-actor animations and social events. There are several other plugin repos folks have made, and I used them as a reference for laying out my own plugins. The links to all those resources are [here](#Resources)

## Usage and Installation

Copy the plugins folder to the folder your assets folder is stored in. 

## Plugin Listing

### Actor Hop
Make your actor do a little hop, or several hops with a set pause between them. Shows up as Actor > Actor Hop. You select an actor, provide the number of hops, and the pause interval. (6 frames is the default, which is roughly 0.1 seconds)

### Social Hop
Do sequential number sets of hops between two actors.

### Player Sprite Select
Some cursed nonsense needs figure if this will even work

### Dialogue Tree Builder
I built too many dialogue trees, so I made a combo of my standard switches for the sake of saving myself some pain in the visual editor

### Calendar Updater
Basically, you want to have a calendar in your game? Do you want to visually track what day it is? Add this plugin, make a scene with the calendar background and a scene with calendar tiles. Add the Calendar Updater event to the scene with the calendar background, and set the variables as listed. (First one is the variable you use for tracking the day, the rest should be unique variables. I recomment Local 0-4)
